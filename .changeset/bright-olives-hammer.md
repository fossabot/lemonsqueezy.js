### Breaking Change

The deprecated `LemonSqueezy` class, all its methods and related types from the library SDK (the `_deprecated` folder) have been removed. 

The class has been deprecated for some time and is no longer needed. Removing this to clean up the codebase and reduce maintenance overhead.

If you were using any deprecated modules, you need to update your imports to use the new modules provided in the library. Visit [Wiki page](https://github.com/lmsqueezy/lemonsqueezy.js/wiki) for function usage.
